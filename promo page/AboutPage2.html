    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Project pong. A passive suggestion quickly arose into an ingenious idea. One year ago,our teacher, Mr Scullion was teaching his class about TCP and UDP traffic through a simple game (click the board to populate the squares; the person with the most squares wins). Accelerating to mass cyber bullying as the entire class ganged up on one student, our teacher grew curious and wondered how much traffic a computer could handle. <br> After playing with this question, the idea of an enormous game with hundreds of people battling each other in one game of pong came to thought. Finding that there was already a record (of 380 people) waiting to be broken, theP0ngProject was created into what it is today. <br>Its purpose may seem futile to some, however there is one simple argument: “it’s cool”. The P0ng has given us a taste of the real world of product development, teaching us how to solve problems independently yet also working as a unit developing our communication skills, and technological experience.
